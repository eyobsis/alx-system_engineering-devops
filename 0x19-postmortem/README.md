# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Overview

This postmortem provides a dramatic yet informative account of the recent web stack outage that left our servers pondering the meaning of life. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a curious user, or just here for the giggles, grab your coffee and enjoy the tale of how our servers took an unexpected coffee break.

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** February 7, 2024, 10:00 AM - February 7, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Approximately 30% of users experienced intermittent downtime and slow response times, as our web app decided to test their patience.
- **Root Cause:** The load balancer got a little too creative, playing traffic favorites and causing an uneven workload distribution among servers.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Monitors woke up on the wrong side of the bed, throwing tantrums about latency and errors.
- **10:15 AM:** Engineers received an alert that was more insistent than a cat demanding breakfast – it was time to wake up and smell the server issues.
- **10:30 AM:** Investigation initiated – imagine a digital detective show, chasing suspects from [databases](#) to [CDNs](#) and even entertaining [gremlins](#).
- **11:30 AM:** Down the rabbit hole of misleading paths, blaming innocent [databases](#) and minding-their-own-business [CDNs](#).
- **12:30 PM:** Distress signal sent to the A-team - senior DevOps engineers and network wizards – because every hero needs a sidekick.
- **1:30 PM:** Load balancer configurations unmasked – playing traffic favorites like a DJ at a house party.
- **2:30 PM:** Configurations scolded and corrected – servers back in action, web app cruising in the fast lane.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:** Load balancer playing playground monitor, unfairly distributing tasks like a teenager picking dodgeball teams.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer sent to configuration rehab, now treating servers equally. Monitoring got an upgrade – superhero capes included.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Automated load balancer configuration checks – no more playing favorites.
  - Monitoring system got a superhero makeover – capes included, ensuring it watches over our servers like a vigilant guardian.
  - Network configuration audits scheduled – Sherlock Holmes hats dusted off, ready for load balancer mysteries.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Load balancer gets a tutorial on fair play – no more biased traffic handling.
  - Runbook documented like a treasure map for the next explorer facing [load balancer mysteries](#).
  - Engineering teams invited to [Load Balancer 101](#) – because everyone deserves to know when the traffic's getting chaotic.

## PS: No servers were harmed in the making of this postmortem, but a load balancer learned a valuable lesson. Stay tuned for our upcoming blockbuster: "The Load Balancer Chronicles: Rise of the Fair Play."
